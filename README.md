# calender


//1- i didnt use a design pattern !

//2- i used date object as a string instead of date formate in notes

//3- as the feauters progress i end up with a spagheti code !

// FACT: it wouldn't be possible without the builtin date object "new Date()" thanks javascript !

Thank You So much to Newton School for Giving me this type of Assignments
